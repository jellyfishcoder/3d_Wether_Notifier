3d_Wether_Notifier
==================

A 3d wether notifier that runs on a Raspberry Pi B+ (or B) and a 4x4x4 RGB LED cube (I got mine from http://bit.do/cube4).  RPi part runs under python 2.  You need to register an api key at http://bit.do/weather-api, don't worry, the free account is all that is needed for this project.
